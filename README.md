**Design, scale, operate. And drink coffee when things break.**

Hi, I'm Cleber — Engineer passionate about building and operating systems that scale and recover gracefully.

I work across cloud infrastructure, architecture, observability, and platform engineering. I enjoy designing resilient systems, automating delivery, and making production less scary.

## 🔧 What I work with

- ☁️ Cloud architecture & infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, containerization)
- 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Helm, GitOps)
- 🧪 CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, CodePipeline, ArgoCD, Jenkins)
- 📈 Observability & Reliability (SLOs, SLIs, metrics, logs, traces)
- 🧯 Incident response & on-call operations (alerts, playbooks, retrospectives)
- 📦 System design & scalability (event-driven, REST/gRPC, async flows)
- 🧱 Platform engineering & internal tooling
- 🧰 Developer experience & operational excellence
- 💰 FinOps & cost-aware architecture (usage analysis, automation, savings plans)
- 🌀 Distributed systems & fault tolerance
- 🧼 Production-readiness, chaos resilience, graceful degradation
